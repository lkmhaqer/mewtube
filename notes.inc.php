/*
* index.php touched a bit, using a bit of the db() class, kinda want to use the pageBuilder() (after its extended a bit) class for it.
* 
* dbinfo.php has all classes (maybe this should change?)
* advfile.php is the backend
* 
* vid.php/stats.php and other random shit should be rewritten into advfile, and then the javascrupt will have to be redone.
